## Objective

Create a responsive, one-page website that gives visitors as much info about the restaurant as possible.

### Wireframe Breakdown
* There is a professional logo for the website.
* There are icons for a Facebook page, Twitter account, Instagram Account and are registered at Open Table.
* The Flickr API was used to fetch all photos for our website.
* There is a "News" section that will be pulled in from an API. Keep in mind this will change frequently so make sure to account for spacing. There is a “Read More” link at the bottom that links out to our blog.
* The specials change each day. This will come from an API and will change daily. The API only includes the name, description, and price so we have used an image from Flickr API.
* There is a Google Map with location, directions, and the restaurant's address.
* There is a tab section containing the "About Subedei" section, a mock reservation form, and the menu.
* Our menu is broken up into three categories. The restaurant only serves dinner, but we pulled in appetizers, main courses, and a-la cart items individually from the API.
* There are three smaller photos of food on the right side of the page pulled from Flickr API.
* Menu Item Info Blocks (Each of our food items has special notes on it, and if a note matches, then the icon should be displayed. Also, there is a hover state that will need to show basic information about the note. This will be the same for all items and here is a breakdown of that.

  * Allergy Info (This item may contain shellfish or another item that some people may be allergic to. Please ask your waiter or waitress for assistance.)
  * Restaurant Favorite (We have been doing this a long time and this item has become one of our favorites.)
  * Spicy (This item is spicy, so please handle with care and drink lots of water.)
  * Vegan (This item contains no meat and has been prepared without the use of animal products.)

### Comments/Reviews Tab
There is a comments and review section that is similar to Disqus.
