## Objective

Create a responsive, one-page website that gives visitors as much info about the restaurant as possible.

### Wireframe Breakdown and Website Details
* Professional logo for the website.
* Icons for a Facebook page, Twitter account, Instagram Account and are registered at Open Table.
* The Flickr API was used to fetch all photos for our website.
* "News" section that will be pulled in from an API. This will change frequently. There is a “Read More” link at the bottom that links to our blog.
* The specials change each day and come from an API. The API only includes the name, description, and price, so we have used an image from Flickr API.
* Google Map with location, directions, and the restaurant's address.
* Tabbed section containing the "About Subedei" section, a mock reservation form, and the menu.
* Our menu is broken up into three categories. The restaurant only serves dinner, but we pulled in appetizers, main courses, and a-la cart items individually from the API.
* There are three smaller photos of food on the right side of the page pulled from Flickr API.
* There is a comments/review section that is similar to Disqus.
* Menu Item Info Blocks (Each of our food items has special notes on it, and if a note matches, then the icon should be displayed. Also, there is a hover state that will need to show basic information about the note. This will be the same for all items and here is a breakdown of that.

  * Allergy Info (This item may contain shellfish or another item that some people may be allergic to. Please ask your waiter or waitress for assistance.)
  * Restaurant Favorite (We have been doing this a long time and this item has become one of our favorites.)
  * Spicy (This item is spicy, so please handle with care and drink lots of water.)
  * Vegan (This item contains no meat and has been prepared without the use of animal products.)
