# Restaurant Group Project for The Iron Yard
## Team Indigo
### Team Members: Andrew Taylor, David Robicheaux, Jenny Penfield

This is the group midterm project for The Iron Yard Front-End Engineering program.

## Deliverables

The task is to create a clean one-page website that gives the visitors as much info about the restaurant as possible.

#### The following are required:

* A new logo
* A picture of the inside of our restaurant
* A feed from our online blog (provided, see API below)
* Our daily special (provided, see API below)
* A Google map with our address and phone number listed
* History of our business (make something up)
* Our menu (provided, see API below)
* Pictures of our food
* Ability to take reservations (fake submission)
* Add the ability to display comments (Disqus)
* The entire website should be responsive

## Scope of Work

### Wireframe Breakdown
* We will create a professional logo for the website.
* There will be icons for a Facebook page, Twitter account, Instagram Account and are registered at Open Table.
* This image should be picture of the inside of our restaurant. You should be able to find a nice one on Flickr’s website. Make sure you have an appropriate license to use it.
* This is our latest news. This will be pulled in from an API that we will provide for you. Keep in mind this will change frequently so make sure to account for spacing. You will probably need to trim the paragraph down and add a “Read More” link at the bottom that links out to our blog. We will fill in the blog link later.
* We change our our specials each day. Again this will come from an API and will change daily. The API only includes the name, description and price so you will need to grab a generic image from Flickr.
* This should be a Google Map and include our address from above.
* Our menu is broken up into three categories. Since we only serve dinner that is all you need to worry about but you'll need to pull in appetizers, main courses and a la cart items individually. Again, this can all be pulled from our API.
* We would like more food photos to show up as well. Again you can pull from Flickr.
* Menu Item Info Blocks

### Each of our food items has special notes on it, and if a note matches, then the icon should be displayed. Also, there is a hover state that will need to show basic information about the note. This will be the same for all items and here is a breakdown of that.

* Allergy Info (This item may contain shellfish or another item that some people may be allergic to. Please ask your waiter or waitress for assistance.)
* Restaurant Favorite (We have been doing this a long time and this item has become one of our favorites.)
* Spicy (This item is spicy, so please handle with care and drink lots of water.)
* Vegan (This item contains no meat and has been prepared without the use of animal products.)

### Comments/Reviews Tab
There will be a tab that allows for reviews using Disqus.
