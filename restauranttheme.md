**RESTAURANT CONCEPT FOR TEAM INDIGO**


 I've already started on a restaurant them proposal, which came to me this morning, inspired by the Mongol empire and general _Top _Chef_-style snootery.  

 Spoof restaurant idea

**Subedei**
*Trans-asiatic Mongol Imperial Fusion*

Since its opening in 2014, Subedei has stayed on the cutting edge of historically-accurate world adventure cuisine. Let us treat you to a feast worthy of the great khans!

Named after Chingis Khan’s greatest general, Subedei brings together the flavors of China, India, Central Asia, Russia, Syria, Iran/Persia, Iraq, the Levant, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, Austria and Poland eloquently incorporated by the culinary traditions of twelfth-century Mongolian steppe culture.
The Mongol empire was not simply about conquest, destruction, and the devastation of farming people by marauding nomads - it was also about cross-cultural exchange.  The Mongol empire turned the arterial silk road between East and West and blew it wide open - what had been a single communication thread became woven into a rich, elaborate imperial tapestry.  Just as Alexander the Great’s conquests created the Hellenic world, Genghis Khan created the modern concept of Asia.

Our chef and founder
Dr. Jacques Temuchin (PhD. History, University of Texas, CV) is one of the leaders of the Historical gastronomy movement.  A dashing explorer flluent in Uyghur, Jurchen, Medieval Russian, and Arabic, Temuchin is an expert in reconstructing medieval recipes with scrupulous attention to detail, and served as head sous chef at Medieval Times, Austin for two years.
“Dr. Jack” is also a captivating lecturer available for two-hour history slideshow/dinner/drinking parties upon request.  

**Rationale**
The concept gives an obvious starting point for images, text and recipe items.  I'm thinking that the inside restaurant photo might be one of those barbaric feast images from B-movies ("Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, what's the difference?") .
The [early] steppe people ate horses and drank horse blood - this allows for some disgusting specials and house specialties.
