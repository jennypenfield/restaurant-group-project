**RESTAURANT CONCEPT FOR TEAM INDIGO**


 I've already started on a restaurant them proposal, which came to me this morning, inspired by the Mongol empire and general _Top _Chef_-style snootery.  

 Spoof restaurant idea

**Subedei**
*Trans-asiatic Mongol Imperial Fusion*

Named after Chingis Khan’s greatest general, Subedei brings together the flavors of China, India, Central Asia, Russia, Syria, Iran/Persia, Iraq, the Levant, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, Austria and Poland eloquently incorporated by the culinary traditions of twelfth-century Mongolian steppe culture. [this is deliberately too many things for one restaurant]   

The Mongol empire was not simply about conquest, destruction, and the devastation of farming people by marauding nomads - it was also about cross-cultural exchange.  The Mongol empire turned the arterial silk road between East and West and blew it wide open - what had been a single communication thread became woven into a rich, elaborate imperial tapestry.  Just as Alexander the Great’s conquests created the Hellenic world, Genghis Khan created the modern concept of Asia.

**Rationale**
The concept gives an obvious starting point for images, text and recipe items.  I'm thinking that the inside restaurant photo might be one of those barbaric feast images from B-movies ("Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, what's the difference?") .
The [early] steppe people ate horses and drank horse blood - this allows for some disgusting specials and house specialties.
